# Overview
This is the Data Profiling Vocabulary (DPV). It is an extension to the DCAT vocabulary that can represent content-related metadata about different types of datasets. For each supported data type, several metadata attributes are provided. Relations between these attributes allow the user to navigate and explore the heterogeneous contents of a data lake. DPV can be easily extended to support additional types of datasets.
